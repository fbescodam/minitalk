# 42_codam_minitalk


## Usage

Compile with `make all`.

Start the server by running `server/server`. Open a second terminal instance, then run the client using `client/client <pid> <message>` where `<pid>` is the PID mentioned by the server on startup and `<message>` is the message you'd like to send to the server.


## How it works

When sending a message, the message is decomposed into bits, where every character takes 1 byte (the size of a `char`). These bytes are sent to the server using `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`, each standing for a 0 and 1 respectively. Upon receiving eight 0 bits in a row (a NULL-terination character in ASCII), the server will display the message and get ready for the next one.

In case the message appears all screwed up, increase the value of `WAIT_TIME_MS` in *client/client.h*.


## Grade

**115/100**. Since the client and server communicate in plain old bits, they both support unicode (as long as the terminal used does).
